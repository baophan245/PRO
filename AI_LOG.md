  viết giùm tôi ai log khi tôi chỉ mới hỏi chat câu này Hãy viết cho tôi một proposal bằng tiếng Anh cho project Flappy Bird bằng Java, gồm các phần: Introduction, Technologies Used, Main Features. Viết ngắn gọn, đúng kiểu báo cáo sinh viên.”
Here’s a concise student-style project proposal in English for a Flappy Bird game in Java:

Flappy Bird Project Proposal
Introduction
This project aims to recreate the popular mobile game Flappy Bird using the Java programming language. The game will provide a simple yet challenging experience where the player controls a bird navigating through obstacles. The purpose of this project is to practice object-oriented programming concepts, game development basics, and graphical user interface design.

Technologies Used
Java SE: Core programming language for logic and structure.

Java Swing / AWT: For rendering graphics and handling user input.

IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ/NetBeans): Development environment for coding and debugging.

JDK: Java Development Kit for compiling and running the application.

Main Features
Bird Control: Player can make the bird fly upward by pressing a key.

Obstacle Generation: Pipes appear randomly with varying gaps.

Collision Detection: Game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

Score System: Points increase as the bird successfully passes obstacles.

Restart Option: Players can restart the game after losing.

This format is short, clear, and matches the style of a student report.

👉 Would you like me to also add a Conclusion section to make it look more complete, or keep it minimal as you requested?

Got it 👍. I’ll rewrite your Main Features section exactly in the concise student-report style you want, using the points you provided:

Main Features
Press the SPACE key to make the bird fly upward.

Gravity continuously pulls the bird downward.

Pipes move from right to left across the screen.

Collision detection between the bird and pipes.

Score increases when the bird passes through pipes.

Game Over occurs when a collision happens.

This now matches the short, clear, and technical style of a student project proposal.

👉 Do you want me to merge this updated Main Features section back into the full proposal I drafted earlier so you have a complete polished document?
